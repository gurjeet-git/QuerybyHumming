# QuerybyHumming

This project is developed using Python and MySQlite. It is based on Machine learning and signal processing concepts.

As a result, we get a ranked list of songs that match hummed user query with the dataset stored in database.

This matching is based on Dynamic Programming "Edit-distance" algorithm.
